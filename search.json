From 2004 to 2010, the league averaged around 19 players with 1,000 rushing yards per season. But from 2011 to 2020, that number crashed and hit a low of just 8 in 2015. Elite 1,500-yard rushers became even rarer, dropping from 5-6 per year in the mid-2000s to just 1-2 in most recent seasons. However, since 2021, we’re seeing a rebound with 1700-1800 yard rushers returning. This suggests teams moved toward running back committees in the 2010s, spreading carries among multiple backs rather than feeding one workhorse. But here’s the real question: does any of this actually matter for winning games? If teams are running more now than they did 20 years ago, does that translate to more wins? Let’s find out.\n\n\nCode\nteam_rush_pct_all &lt;- pbp_all |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(posteam), play_type %in% c(\"run\", \"pass\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(season, posteam) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    rush_plays = sum(play_type == \"run\"),\n    total_plays = n(),\n    rush_pct = (rush_plays / total_plays) * 100,\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nschedules_all &lt;- load_schedules(2004:2024)\n\nteam_wins_all &lt;- schedules_all |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    home_win = if_else(home_score &gt; away_score, 1, 0),\n    away_win = if_else(away_score &gt; home_score, 1, 0)\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(home_team, away_team),\n    names_to = \"home_away\",\n    values_to = \"team\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    win = if_else(home_away == \"home_team\", home_win, away_win)\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(season, team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    wins = sum(win, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nteam_full_all &lt;- team_rush_pct_all |&gt;\n  left_join(team_wins_all, by = c(\"season\" = \"season\", \"posteam\" = \"team\"))\n\noverall_corr &lt;- cor(team_full_all$rush_pct, team_full_all$wins, use = \"complete.obs\")\n\nggplot(team_full_all, aes(x = rush_pct, y = wins)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 2, color = \"#d00000\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"#0066cc\", linewidth = 2) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 17), breaks = seq(0, 17, 2)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(30, 60)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Running More Doesn't Guarantee More Wins\",\n    subtitle = paste0(\"All NFL teams, 2004-2024 seasons | Correlation: \", round(overall_corr, 3)),\n    x = \"Rush Percentage (% of plays that are rushes)\",\n    y = \"Wins\",\n    caption = \"Source: nflverse | By Joel Hammond\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, color = \"gray40\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 11),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, color = \"gray50\", hjust = 0)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot reveals that rushing percentage has only a weak correlation (0.269) with winning. While there’s a slight upward trend, the massive spread of dots shows teams can win with any rushing attack. Some teams run 50%+ of the time and barely win 4 games. Others run less than 40% and win 14+ games. The data is clear, it’s not about running more, it’s about evolving and using the best strategy. So, is the NFL run game dying? Absolutely not. The data tells a story that contradicts the popular narrative. Despite what you hear from analysts and fans, teams are actually running the ball more than they did 20 years ago. The so called “death” of the run game never happened. What did happen was an evolution. The mid-2010s saw a dramatic shift toward running back committees, with elite 1,000-yard rushers dropping from 24 in 2006 to just 8 in 2015. Teams experimented with spreading carries among multiple backs rather than feeding a single workhorse. But since 2021, we’ve seen a return to feature backs. The other revealing finding is that running the ball more doesn’t have any correlation to winning more. This proves that it isn’t about volume, it’s about execution. Some of the league’s best teams run heavily. Others win by airing it out. What matters isn’t your philosophy, but how well you execute it.The NFL run game didn’t die. It adapted, evolved, and found its place in modern football. And the data proves it’s here to stay."

From 2004 to 2010, the league averaged around 19 players with 1,000 rushing yards per season. But from 2011 to 2020, that number crashed and hit a low of just 8 in 2015. Elite 1,500-yard rushers became even rarer, dropping from 5-6 per year in the mid-2000s to just 1-2 in most recent seasons. However, since 2021, we’re seeing a rebound with 1700-1800 yard rushers returning. This suggests teams moved toward running back committees in the 2010s, spreading carries among multiple backs rather than feeding one workhorse. But here’s the real question: does any of this actually matter for winning games? If teams are running more now than they did 20 years ago, does that translate to more wins? Let’s find out.\n\n\nCode\nteam_rush_pct_all &lt;- pbp_all |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(posteam), play_type %in% c(\"run\", \"pass\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(season, posteam) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    rush_plays = sum(play_type == \"run\"),\n    total_plays = n(),\n    rush_pct = (rush_plays / total_plays) * 100,\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nschedules_all &lt;- load_schedules(2004:2024)\n\nteam_wins_all &lt;- schedules_all |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    home_win = if_else(home_score &gt; away_score, 1, 0),\n    away_win = if_else(away_score &gt; home_score, 1, 0)\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(home_team, away_team),\n    names_to = \"home_away\",\n    values_to = \"team\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    win = if_else(home_away == \"home_team\", home_win, away_win)\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(season, team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    wins = sum(win, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nteam_full_all &lt;- team_rush_pct_all |&gt;\n  left_join(team_wins_all, by = c(\"season\" = \"season\", \"posteam\" = \"team\"))\n\noverall_corr &lt;- cor(team_full_all$rush_pct, team_full_all$wins, use = \"complete.obs\")\n\nggplot(team_full_all, aes(x = rush_pct, y = wins)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 2, color = \"#d00000\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"#0066cc\", linewidth = 2) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 17), breaks = seq(0, 17, 2)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(30, 60)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Running More Doesn't Guarantee More Wins\",\n    subtitle = paste0(\"All NFL teams, 2004-2024 seasons | Correlation: \", round(overall_corr, 3)),\n    x = \"Rush Percentage (% of plays that are rushes)\",\n    y = \"Wins\",\n    caption = \"Source: nflverse | By Joel Hammond\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, color = \"gray40\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 11),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, color = \"gray50\", hjust = 0)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot reveals that rushing percentage has only a weak correlation (0.269) with winning. While there’s a slight upward trend, the massive spread of dots shows teams can win with any rushing attack. Some teams run 50%+ of the time and barely win 4 games. Others run less than 40% and win 14+ games. The data is clear, it’s not about running more, it’s about evolving and using the best strategy. So, is the NFL run game dying? Absolutely not. The data tells a story that contradicts the popular narrative. Despite what you hear from analysts and fans, teams are actually running the ball more than they did 20 years ago. The so called “death” of the run game never happened. What did happen was an evolution. The mid-2010s saw a dramatic shift toward running back committees, with elite 1,000-yard rushers dropping from 24 in 2006 to just 8 in 2015. Teams experimented with spreading carries among multiple backs rather than feeding a single workhorse. But since 2021, we’ve seen a return to feature backs. The other revealing finding is that running the ball more doesn’t have any correlation to winning more. This proves that it isn’t about volume, it’s about execution. Some of the league’s best teams run heavily. Others win by airing it out. What matters isn’t your philosophy, but how well you execute it.The NFL run game didn’t die. It adapted, evolved, and found its place in modern football. And the data proves it’s here to stay."

    "text": "In 2008, the Detroit Lions ended their season with an 0-16 record, making them the first team in NFL history to finish a season with no wins. This sounds bad, and it is, but Detroit fans were all but used to it. The Lions organization originated in 1930 and were a decently successful team up until the super bowl era in 1966. During the super bowl era, up until 2020, the Lions had won 332 times compared to their 439 losses, while only winning one playoff game. Due to this, they were known as one of the worst franchises in all of sports.\nBut something changed in 2021 when the Lions hired Dan Campbell at Head Coach. Coach Campbell instantly drew attention from the media as in his opening press conference he famously said “We’re gonna kick you in the teeth, all right? And when you punch us back, we’re gonna smile at you, and when you knock us down, we’re going to get up. And on the way up, we’re going to bite a kneecap off.” This gave Lions fans a spark and a new confidence had grown in Detroit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese graphs show the Lions offensive and defensive efficiency pre and post Dan Campbell. The difference is obvious and truly astounding. Before Campbell, the Lions were consistently one of the worst teams on offense and defense. After, it changed for the better. Every season under Campbell, the Lions improved on both sides of the ball, which ultimately led to more wins.\nHow exactly did this happen though. How was Campbell able to turn around a franchise that had only won one playoff game in 54 years. Diving deeper into how he was able to do this. The first thing to look at was the rushing attack, as Campbell wanted to begin his rebuild in the trenches."
